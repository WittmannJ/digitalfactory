## What is DigitalFactory by TZ PULS
Digital Factory by TZ PULS is a simple webapp for collecting accelerometer data produced by the smartphone's internal accelerometer. It servers as a learning app for a course teached at the TZ PULS. With it students are able to gather their own data and do some basic data science on said data.

A working demo of the webapp can be found at: [Link to webapp](https://wittmannj.github.io/digitalfactory/)

**Important:** Currently the app works only on Chrome Android/ Opera Android/ Samsung Internet and WebView Android [(source)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Accelerometer#browser_compatibility) due to incompatibility issues with the Accelerometer-API

Tutorial for importing 2D Json Arrays into excel (not important right now since the the export to json-functionality currently only produces a 1D Json Array for which the import is very straight-forward. But in future releases the App should be able to capture input from all three axes (x,y,z) of the accelerometer) [Link to help with importing 2D JSON Arrays into Excel](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Power-Query/Multi-Dimensional-Json-file-to-Table/m-p/114387?lightbox-message-images-114387=26437i84E9ED0BB1A12C48#M7720)
